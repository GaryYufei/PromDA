The O
surge O
of O

during O

come O
amid O

Geraghty B-Person

that O
the O

" O

The O
Agriculture B-Organization

ease O

The O
plan O
has O
raised O

avocado O
growers O
, O
who O
are O
largely O
concentrated O
in O

California B-Location
growers O
have O
charged O
that O
removing O
the O
restrictions O

even O
on O
a O
limited O
basis O
, O
would O
endanger O
the O
$ O

if O

harmful O
Mexican B-Miscellaneous
insects O
were O
brought O

Mexican B-Miscellaneous
officials O
contend O
that O
there O
is O
no O
scientific O
basis O
for O
the O
ban O

that O
it O
is O
illegal O

his O

He O
made O

He O
