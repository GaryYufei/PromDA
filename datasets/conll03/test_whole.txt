added O
that O
even O
if O
the O
conditions O
were O
met O
by O
both O

, O
final O

would O
hinge O
on O
an O

between O
Britain B-Location

the O
United B-Location

to O
liberalise O

which O

which O
was O

" O
I O
agree O

that O

there O

no O

be O
cleared O
. O

The O
conditions O
for O

it O

those O
imposed O
by O
other O

authorities O
on O
similar O

. O

British B-Organization
Airways I-Organization
's O
initial O
response O
was O
that O
" O
unconditional O
divestiture O

unprecedented O

it O
must O
be O
on O

said O
both O

Lieutenant-General O
Maurice B-Person
Baril I-Person
told O
a O
news O
conference O
in O
Nairobi B-Location
his O
main O
concern O
was O
for O
a O
large O
group O
of O
about O
150,000 O
refugees O
living O
off O
the O
land O
in O
a O
valley O
about O
65 O
km O
( O
40 O
miles O
) O
west O
of O
the O
eastern O
city O
of O
Goma B-Location
. O

If O
he O
decided O
it O
was O
necessary O
and O
safe O
for O
the O
aircrew O
, O
he O
would O
not O
hesitate O
to O
order O
airdrops O
of O
food O
for O
the O
refugees O
, O
even O
against O
the O
wishes O
of O
the O
government O
in O
Kinshasa B-Location
and O
the O
Zairean B-Miscellaneous
rebels O
who O
control O
much O
of O
eastern O
Zaire B-Location
, O
he O
said O
. O

" O
Tomorrow O
I O
'm O
going O
into O
Rwanda B-Location
and O
my O
intention O
is O
to O
go O
across O
into O
eastern O
Zaire B-Location

try O
to O
find O
out O
for O
the O
second O

what O
the O
situation O
is O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

General O
Baril B-Person
saw O
rebel O
leader O
Laurent B-Person
Kabila I-Person
in O
Goma B-Location
last O
week O
but O
the O
rebels O
told O
him O
the O
crisis O
was O
over O
because O
most O
of O
the O
Rwandan B-Miscellaneous
refugees O
have O
already O
gone O
home O
. O

The O
rebels O
do O
not O
want O
the O
multinational O
force O
to O
deploy O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
for O
fear O
it O
might O
help O
the O
Zairean B-Miscellaneous
army O
regain O
control O
of O
the O
area O
. O

Kinshasa B-Location
opposes O
airdrops O
, O
apparently O
because O
the O
food O
could O
fall O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
rebels O
and O
their O
local O
supporters O
. O

Canadian B-Miscellaneous
Defence O
Minister O
Doug B-Person
Young I-Person
said O
on O
Thursday O
that O
the O
multinational O
force O
would O
probably O
not O
have O
to O
make O
food O
airdrops O
or O
intervene O
militarily O
in O
any O
major O
way O
. O

" O
It O
does O
n't O
look O
as O
though O
they O
( O
airdrops O
) O
are O
going O
to O
be O
required O
in O
any O
significant O
way O
because O
the O
NGOs O
( O

) O
are O
in O
that O
area O
on O
the O
border O
between O
Zaire B-Location
and O
Rwanda B-Location
, O
" O
Young B-Person
told O
reporters O
. O

But O
General O
Baril B-Person
said O
it O
would O
be O
premature O
to O
rule O
out O
any O
course O
of O
action O
until O
he O
had O
more O
information O
. O

" O
We O
hope O
that O
if O
the O
front O
moves O
forward O
or O
stabilises O
then O
we O
will O
have O
access O
( O
to O
the O
large O
group O
of O
refugees O
) O
with O
reconnaissance O
or O
humanitarian O
agencies O
. O

" O
If O
they O
ca O
n't O
move O
because O
they O
are O
too O
weak O
, O
then O
we O
will O
probably O
consider O
very O
seriously O
using O
air O
delivery O
means O
( O
airdrops O
) O
...It O
's O
complex O
, O
it O
's O
dangerous O
for O
the O
air O
crew O
that O
fly O
in O
there O
and O
it O
will O
have O
to O
be O
absolutely O
necessary O

If O
it O
is O
necessary O
, O
I O
wo O
n't O
hesitate O
to O
use O
it O
, O
" O
he O
said O

Asked O
if O
he O
would O
disregard O
the O
objections O
of O
the O
Zairean B-Miscellaneous
government O
, O
he O
said O
: O
" O
It O
would O

to O

have O
to O

" O
Hakme B-Person

" O
We O
believe O
the O

" O

A O

Hakme B-Person
attributes O
Brazil B-Location

fascination O
with O

not O
to O

to O
the O

CANBERRA B-Location

The O
Australian B-Miscellaneous
opposition O
on O
Friday O
demanded O
a O
high-powered O
investigation O
into O
paedophilia O
in O
the O
Australian B-Miscellaneous

service O
after O
the O
federal O
court O
forced O
the O
head O
of O
the O
existing O
inquiry O
to O
stand O
aside O
. O

The O
court O
said O
inquiry O
head O
Chris B-Person
Hunt I-Person
might O
be O
biased O

since O

if O
